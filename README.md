# AUC_ROC-curve_and-shiny
To validate the gene expression of the gene of interest in selected or all samples, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is plotted which provides a measure of sensitivity and specificity of the gene expression levels as a binary classifier across all the specified samples. 
The pROC package in R was used to plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC. 
For example, focused on a specific probe id, assuming its gene symbol is known, this script can be used.
With the Shiny package for R, you can convert your R code into interactive applications that can be accessed through a web browser. Shiny is a package for R that enables users to create 
web applications that are interactive
